# Continue your SAP Build Learning Journey
## Potential Scenarios
Discovering potential scenarios for implementing low-code/no-code solutions can be approached in several ways:
- **Address Daily Pain Points**: Start by reviewing your daily operational challenges and bottlenecks. Look for tasks or processes that are repetitive, time-consuming, or error-prone.
- **Industry-Specific Compliance**: Consider industry-specific regulations or compliance requirements that your organization must adhere to. Low-code/no-code solutions can help streamline compliance processes.
- **Leverage Pre-Built Content**: Explore pre-built content available in the store for inspiration. SAP Build offers a range of low-code/no-code use case examples categorized by line of business, along with pre-built content to expedite development.

When contemplating the types of use cases suitable for your organization, it's crucial to assess your organization's digital maturity and consider factors influencing the complexity of digitizing and automating activities. This evaluation will aid in prioritizing your efforts.<br>

## LCNC Use Cases
Low-code/no-code platforms empower you to build, adapt, enhance, and innovate various business processes with minimal reliance on IT. Here are some illustrative examples:
- **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Streamline manual and repetitive tasks such as copying and pasting data into spreadsheets.
- **Digitalize Manual Processes**: Transform manual and semi-automated processes, like capital expenditure approvals, into streamlined digital workflows.
- **Manage High-Volume Tasks**: Automate processes with a high volume of steps, such as data entry for sales orders.
- **Aggregate Data**: Automatically consolidate data from multiple systems and keep purchase records updated.
- **Enhance Standard Business Flows**: Customize and extend standard business application workflows, whether they are SAP or non-SAP, on-premise, or in the cloud. For example, add multiple levels of approval for sales orders.
- **Cross-Application Workflows**: Automate end-to-end cross-application workflows that span multiple systems, such as integrating your ERP system with your human resources (HR) system for streamlined employee onboarding processes.

- ***Stages of Automation Maturity***:<br>
To align your use cases with different stages of automation maturity, consider the following questions, which can also be applied to your organization's overall state:
    - **Use Case Maturity**: Are most of your use cases currently situated at the less mature, non-standardized end of the spectrum, or have they reached the mature, hyperautomated stage?

- ***Interaction with Automation***:<br>
Assess your current perspective on the type of automation work you're contemplating:
    - **Ad Hoc Changes**: Are you primarily focused on making ad hoc changes because most of your processes are manual, paper-based, and lack automation?
    - **Integration Opportunity**: Do you already have some automation in place, and are you considering how to opportunistically link these islands of automation to create more integrated experiences?
    - **Standardization**: Have you implemented many automation best practices and now intend to standardize these processes end-to-end to enhance compliance?
    - **Advanced Integration**: Are you more advanced and aiming to deliver a seamless blend of human-led processes and digital workers?

- ***Understanding Complexity***:
Understanding the complexity of automating processes and developing applications for your use cases is essential for prioritization, especially when working collaboratively with a team. Consider four key factors:
    - **Collaboration & Access**:
      How many participants or departments are involved in the process?<br>
      What is the level of collaboration among process participants?<br>
      Who plays a role in the process?<br>
      How and when do participants need access to the project?<br>
    - **Timing**:
      How often do new process instances occur?<br>
      What is the duration of a single instance of the process?<br>
    - **Routes**:
      How complex are the routes within the process?<br>
      How much logic is required to determine the process's path?<br>
      What kinds of decisions are made within the process?<br>
    - **Data & Metrics**:
      What data is essential to run the process?<br>
      How many system integrations are necessary, including potential SAP integrations?<br>
      How are metrics and reports utilized for tracking the current status?<br>
      Who within your organization requires access to these metrics and reports?<br>
      Evaluating these factors will help you assess the complexity of your automation projects and prioritize them effectively based on your organization's needs and goals.<br>

## Pre-built Content
After completing your initial training and feeling prepared to dive into low-code/no-code development, the simplest way to start is by utilizing pre-built content, often referred to as content packages, learning packages, plug-ins, apps, or extensions. These components serve as the foundational building blocks for low-code/no-code automation and application development, and they have already been crafted for the most common enterprise use cases. They not only accelerate your development efforts but also provide valuable insights into industry or line-of-business best practices.

When you identify a process that can benefit from automation, your first destination should be the marketplaces where these extensions are cataloged. Even better, take the time to explore all the pre-built content packages and integrations relevant to your role and industry. You'll likely discover solutions that are readily available for activation, simplifying your development journey.
