> - ***Page Selector***: Lets you create new pages and switch which page is displayed.
> - - ***Special Areas***: Data for bringing data into the app, Launch for launching and testing the app.
> - ***Canvas***: where you build the interface.
> - ***Components***: components that can be added to the canvas, buttons, images, etc.
> - ***Properties***: where you configure the components you added. Also for other things you have to configure, like the page or logic components.
> - ***Tree View***: all the components on the page are shown here in a tree hierarchy.
> - ***View/Variables***: There is also the logic pane where you indicate how the application should react to the ser and other events. By default, this is closed, but you can open it up by clicking the link at the bottom of the canvas.

## Logic Pane

How the application should react to the user and other events.<br>
It works like the canvas, with widgets on the left that you can drag into your logic pane and that you connect to one another.<br> 
These widgets are called *flow functions* – because you are creating a flow of actions, starting from the triggering event through all the flow functions you connect to it.<br>

## UI component tools
The components area on the left of the screen contains all the UI components for bringing onto the screen.<br>
There are three tabs: 
> - ***Core***: Contains about 25 basic components, like buttons and input fields.
> - ***Marketplace***: Contains many more complex components that you can install into your app. Choose Marketplace to view a whole world of components.
> - ***Installed***: Shows all components you've installed, both core and Marketplace components.

## Backends of SAP Build Apps
SAP Build Apps lets you create your own data sources – you can design data tables, called entities, and populate them with data. These data sources can then be used in your applications, instead of you relying on only data from external sources.<br>

> - ***Entities***: DB tables that cotain tabular data.
> - ***Functions***: Actions that can use the data but also make calculations and return subsets of the data based on parameters sent from the application.
> - ***Deployment***: When the entities and functions are ready, you need to deploy them. Once deployed, they can be used by your applications.
