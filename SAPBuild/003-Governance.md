# SAP Build Governance Capabilities
Citizen developers will be able to build apps and processes with SAP Build. These apps have to be secure, scalable, and compliant with corporate standards.<br>
These developments must be controlled by IT. Shadow-IT (bypassing official channels and use unsanctioned software) must be prevented.<br>

It's important to remember that an unregulated environment can bring various problems and difficulties.<br> 
These include:
- Security risks
- Compliance issues
- Integration problems
- Using resources poorly or making too many similar things
- Making things that aren't supported
- Losing control

By managing how low-code platforms and citizen developers making things are handled, these issues can be lessened.
This happens by setting up clear rules and ways of doing things for technology use and communication, and by helping users get the hang of it.

## Governance Triad
### People 
*Roles and Personas* <br>
Creating a ***Center of Excellence (CoE)*** for low-code is really important.<br>
The CoE offers direction, supervision, and help to teams using tools like SAP Build.<br> 
It takes charge of governing, training, improving quality, and managing solutions throughout their existence.<br> 
This makes sure that low-code advancements match up with what your business requires and values.<br>
### Process
Creation of an *IT Trust Blueprint*. (Define standards, train citizen developers, etc.)<br>
This blueprint sets out the rules, processes, and guidelines for using low-code tools and methods that match up with IT policies and procedures.<br>
It should define processes for data security, compliance, and governance, and establish clear roles and responsibilities for IT and business stakeholders.<br>
Deciding how things should be built, tested, and put into action, and making sure these ways are always used.<br> 
### Tools and Technologies
*DevOps, Access and Authorization, Lifecycle mgmt., Testing, Monitoring*<br>
CI/CD, Version control, Automated testing, Data security<br>
To use APIs in a secure and good way, it's important to have clear rules for how they're made and used.<br>

## Governance in SAP Build
The best option to govern SAP Build is to set up an IT-led Center of Excellence (CoE).<br>
This CoE should be responsible of:
- Safely Scale Development: implementing guardrails with built-in security, curated APIs, Action Projects, Policies, Approvals, and Development processes. 
- Low-Code DevOps: integrating enterprise-class DevOps into your processes.(CI/CD, Lifecycle Management)
- Fusion Development: Co-creation models and capabilities that promote collaboration between IT, Line of Business (LoB) developers, and citizen developers.
- Operationalized Governance: establishing and leveraging CoE and Community of Practice (CoP) frameworks, and using methods and toolkits to effectively enable builders of all skill levels.

The CoE could initiate with a pilot phase to gather practical insights, followed by strategizing and implementing the broader rollout.<br>
*Pilot -> Set Strategy -> Prepare Rollout -> Rollout*<br>

### Toolkit
SAP provides a pre-built Digital Center of Excellence toolkit for SAP Build.<br>
The toolkit will help IT admins to manage and collaborate with citizen developers and to create an entry point for everything low-code builders need to be successful.<br>
It leverages SAP Build Work Zone.<br>
