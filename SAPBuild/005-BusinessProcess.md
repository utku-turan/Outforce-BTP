# Business Process
## Steps of Business Processes
The typical steps in a business process are:
- Inititation
- Data Collection
- Routing (Process participants must be involved to review the data and move the process forward.)
- Decision
- Human Task (Process participants may need to collect more data.)
- New Data

## Key roles in a Business Process
- **Primary participant:** Process owner, Process initiator
- **Secondary participant:** Decision maker, Process participants
- **Stakeholder(kept Informed):** Process instance reviewer, Process metrics reviewer

Let’s shed some more light on the involved roles:
- **Process Owner:** is overall, responsible for a process from the business perspective. Needs to trigger process adjustments when something does not run smoothly.
- **Process Initiator:** starts the process by performing an action. This can happen knowingly or unknowingly.
- **Decision Maker:** is responsible for taking decisions that influence the direction of the process. Approvals or rejections naturally lead to different process outcomes.
- **Process Participants:** need to perform certain tasks within the process. These can be physical tasks or tasks performed within software systems.
- **Process Instance Reviewer and Process Metrics Reviewer:** has a particular interest in certain process runs or the overall process metrics due to their job description.

## Business Process Management (BPM)
Business Process Management (BPM) is an approach used to identify, analyze, measure, and improve an organization’s processes. BPM is not to be seen as just another software in your company, but rather as a strive for operational excellence. It helps a company run faster, better, and at a lower expense, too.

***Business Process Management (BPM)*** encompasses a wide field that considers individuals, data, systems, and various elements contributing to outcomes aligned with business strategies. To enhance operational clarity and mitigate problems stemming from ineffective processes, enterprises adopt the strategic approach of BPM. This practice offers businesses several benefits, including heightened agility, establishment of standardized best practices, operational enhancements, and improved predictability.<br>

***Six Stages of BPM:*** 
- Design
- Model
- Implement
- Monitor
- Optimize
- Reengineer

***Business Process Management Software (BPMS)*** comprises a range of functionalities, including communication tools, process mapping capabilities, analytics features, a process engine, form creation capabilities, seamless integration with external systems, rule-based workflow management, and mechanisms for streamlined approvals.<br>

BPMS offers employees a set of standardized tools to manage processes, and to help problems become visible quicker. In a company running thousands of processes, it can be challenging for management to see where things are going wrong. Here, BPMS drives efficiency.
Faster identification of breakdowns and processes means quicker response times and quicker fixes. This leads to organizational agility, which is a competitive advantage. It also means solutions are defined and implemented when they are needed.

Finally, BPMS strengthens teamwork from two key perspectives:
- Firstly, *collaboration between departments* becomes easier, more automatic, and requires less administrative effort.
- Secondly, it *frees people up from doing boring work* that can be taken care of by technology, allowing them to spend more time connecting personally and working creatively together.

BPMS functionalities:
- **Communication**: Activity monitoring and dashboards to deliver instant visibility into system and business health.
- **Process Mapping**: A visual process designer, enabling people to sketch a process out.
- **Analytics**: Reports and analytics, which give insights into key performance indicators.
- **Process Engine**: Testing and simulation tools, allowing you to run new processes before moving them to production.
- **Form Creation**: A drag-and-drop form builder, allowing data to be entered and routed to relevant departments.
- **Ability to Integrate**: Integrations with existing systems, including API support, webhooks and features that help to eliminate manual data sharing.
- **Rule-based Workflows**: Workflow management features, a rule-based way to manage access and roles, assign tasks and set deadlines.
- **Approval Mechanisms**: They allow for decisions to be made and to advance a process as it progresses through the steps.
