# Interactive Forms
After crafting a form, you can employ it to initiate a process or introduce an approval phase within the process. These forms are easily generated in the *Form Builder* by dragging and dropping text elements and input fields onto the canvas. Each form adheres to a *single layout* and *access point*, incorporating *traceable actions*. Their design is meticulously crafted to engage the appropriate stakeholders at the most opportune moments.
