# Interactive Forms
Once you have created a form, you can use it to trigger a process to start or add an approval step in the process. The trigger form is the starting point of your business process.

You can define two different types of triggers:
- Using a form as a process trigger gives you an opportunity to use a direct link to the published form to start. Alternatively, you can embed the starting trigger into a tile in SAP workzone edition with the given parameters:

- Using an API call as a process trigger, you can start your business process via API call. To do this, you have to define the required input parameters and reuse them as, for example, input fields:

After you have defined your trigger form, it is time to add approval forms to your business process via drag and drop functionality in the forms builder tool. Approval forms are intended to capture and share information. With that, you can simplify and accelerate business approval processes used by business users. Approval forms automatically provide the choice to approve or reject the request with the according notification.
