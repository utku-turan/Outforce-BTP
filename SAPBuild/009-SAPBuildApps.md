# Composing a No-Code Mobile App With SAP Build
Application development main areas: 
- User Interface
- Logic
- Data

With SAP Build Apps, you can build two types of projects: 
- An application.
- A backend, that is, a database for storing data for an application.

SAP Build Apps is deployed in a cloud environment managed by SAP Business Technology Platform. SAP Build Apps is embedded directly into SAP Service Cloud, allowing all users to build customer user interfaces that seamlessly extend SAP Service Cloud capabilities.<br>

SAP AppGyver Community Edition remains available through AppGyver.com, and it will still continue to serve it's 300,000 creators with the free service and a more limited feature set.<br>
