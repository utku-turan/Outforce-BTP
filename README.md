# Outforce-BTP
[//]: # (Hi there,
My name is Utku and I am working as an ABAP developer since 2007.
To be honest, I have never been an "open-source developer". I like to keep my code and my notes to myself, but times are changing, and so should I.
That's why, I'll try to transfer as much as I can to public repositories starting from my BTP notes. It will probably take some time.)

Documents created by me during my SAP BTP learning journey

Feel free to contact me at utku.turan(@)outforce.tech for any inquiries.
Cheers
