# Outforce-BTP
[//]: # (Hi there,
My name is Utku and I am working as an ABAP developer since 2007.
To be honest, I have never been an "open-source developer". I like to keep my code and my notes to myself, but times are changing, and so should I.
Hence, I've decided to begin sharing more of my work in public repositories, starting with this repository containing my notes on BTP. It might take a while to get everything ready, as I'll need to tidy up the formatting a little bit to make them easier to understand.)

Documents created by me during my SAP BTP learning journey

Feel free to contact me at utku.turan(@)outforce.tech for any inquiries.
Cheers
